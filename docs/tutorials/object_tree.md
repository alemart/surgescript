Object tree
===========

Introduction
------------

In SurgeScript, objects have a hierarchical relationship. Suppose that object P *spawns* (or *instantiates*) object C. We say that object P is the *parent* of C. Similarly, object C is a *child* of P.

An object may spawn many children. However, all objects have only one parent. This relationship between objects forms a hierarchy (a tree). The Figure below shows an example:

In this example, Level is the parent of GameItem1 and GameItem2. Components A and B are children of GameItem1, but not of GameItem2. Level has two children and GameItem2 has zero. Finally, GameItem1, GameItem2, Component A and Component B are all *descendants* of Level.

In SurgeScript, the root of the hierarchy is a predefined object called `System`. Its parent is itself. All other objects are descendants of `System`.

Spawning objects
----------------

You can use `spawn()` to instantiate an object. Example:

```cs
object "Parent"
{
    child = spawn("Child");

    state "main"
    {
    }
}

object "Child"
{
    state "main"
    {
    }
}
```

Function `spawn()` may be invoked on objects other than the caller. In this case, the caller won't be the parent of the newly created object:

```cs
object "Parent"
{
    child = spawn("Child");
    grandChild = child.spawn("Child");

    state "main"
    {
    }
}
```

> **Automatic Garbage Collection**
>
> When you spawn an object, make sure you store a reference to it somewhere.
>
> If an object cannot be reached from the root (no reachable object has any references to it), it will be automatically destroyed by SurgeScript's built-in Garbage Collector.



Destroying objects
------------------

Objects can be destroyed manually by calling `destroy()`. Whenever an object is destroyed, its children are destroyed as well.

```cs
object "Foo"
{
    state "main"
    {
        Console.print("This object does nothing.");
        destroy();
    }
}
```

Traversing the hierarchy
------------------------

Relevant data about the object hierarchy can be obtained using the following properties and functions (find out more about them at the [Object reference](/reference/object)):

Function / property|Description
-------------------|-----------
`obj.parent` | The parent object
`obj.child(name)` | Gets a child object named `name`
`obj.findObject(name)` | Finds a descendant named `name`
`obj.__childCount` | Number of immediate children

Example:

```cs
object "Parent"
{
    child = spawn("Child");
    otherChild = spawn("Child");

    state "main"
    {
        Console.print("This object has " + this.__childCount + " children.");
        destroy();
    }
}
```

The output is as follows:

```
This object has 2 children.
```
