Comments
========

Comments are used to make your code more human-readable. They are ignored by the computer. SurgeScript allows two kinds of comments: single-line comments and multi-line comments.

Single-line comments
--------------------

Single-line comments start with a `//`. Example:

```cs
// This line has no effect on the code (it's just for improved readability)
x = 3 + 4; // x is now 7
```

Multi-line comments
-------------------

Multi-line comments start with a `/*` and end with a `*/`. Example:

```cs
/*
 * Comments can, but don't have to, take
 * multiple lines if you use this form.
 */
x = 3 + 4; /* x is now 7 */
```

Comments of this form cannot be nested.
